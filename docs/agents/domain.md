# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/design.md`** when the task touches Patch Run control flow, trust boundaries,
  persistence, Approval, Verification, Resource Budgets, or Run Artifacts.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If either location doesn't exist, proceed silently. The domain-modeling skill creates files lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repository:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   ├── design.md
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-example-decision.md
│       └── 0002-another-decision.md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept—in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name—use the term defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If a needed concept isn't in the glossary, either reconsider the term or note a genuine gap for domain modeling.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007, but worth reopening because…_
